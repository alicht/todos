### Skills: Strings, Methods?

## Instructions

In this lab you'll be practicing manipulating strings.

1. In encoder.rb create a method that will take a string and apply methods from the String class to it to make the original meaning of the string difficult to discern.
 
2. In decoder.rb create a program that will take that mutated string from encoder.rb and will return it to its original configuration, making the meaning of the string clear again.
